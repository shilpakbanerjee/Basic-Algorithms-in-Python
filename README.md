# Basic-Algorithms-in-Python

## This repository contains some popular algorithms implemented in Python:

- *binary_search.py*

- *change.py*	

- *covering_segments.py*	

- *different_summands.py*	

- *dot_product.py*

- *fibonacci.py* : Input is a single natural number n and output is the n-th Fibonacci number 

- *fibonacci_huge.py* : Input consits of two natural numbers n and m separated by a space and output is n-th Fibonacci number mod m. We use Pisano periods for fast computations.

- *fibonacci_last_digit.py* : Input is a single natural number n (possibly large) and output is the n-th Fibonacci number mod 10

- *fibonacci_partial_sum.py* : Input consits of two natural numbers n and m (n > m) separated by a space and output is the sum of n-m+1 Fibonacci numbers (from the m-th to the n-th) mod 10

- *fibonacci_sum_last_digit.py*	: Input is a single natural number n and output is the sum of the first n+1 Fibonacci numbers (from the 0-th to the n-th) mod 10

- *fractional_knapsack.py*

- *gcd.py* : Input consits of two natural numbers a and b separated by a space and output is GCD(a,b). We use the Euclidean algorithm. 

- *inversions.py*

- *knapsack.py*

- *largest_number.py*

- *lcm.py* : Input consits of two natural numbers a and b separated by a space and output is LCM(a,b).

- *majority_element.py*

- *primitive_calculator.py*	

- *sorting.py*
